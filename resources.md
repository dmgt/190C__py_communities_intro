### Suggestions for continuing with the python community

Following up on interest from the end of last semester, if you are curious to get more involved with python community and events, here's a few suggestions.

In addition, I've collected some undergrad internship opportunities for next summer at the end.

There's a lot else out there - additions to this list are very welcome! (please add a pull request on GitHub)

#### UC Berkeley campus

-   Check out the [discussion groups and lectures](https://bids.berkeley.edu/events) at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (can subscribe to their mailing list), many of which use python. Past lectures are online [here](https://bids.berkeley.edu/resources/videos), including [this](https://bids.berkeley.edu/resources/videos/project-jupyter-architecture-and-evolution-open-platform-modern-data-science) talk by Fernando Perez about the history and applications of Jupyter, which started from a project he created as a grad student in 2001.
-   [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/) runs free hands-on workshops including python fundamentals, text mining, data visualization etc
-   [http://python.berkeley.edu](http://python.berkeley.edu) doesn't seem to be an active meetup any more, but the site lists tons of intro python resources

#### East Bay

-   [PyLadies / Women Who Code Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Oakland-PyLadies/)
    -   Informal coworking and Q&A, hosts ligtning talks and speakers
    -   Usually every other Monday evening at NextSpace by Berkeley BART
    -   Usually 5-10 people, free, bring your own snacks

#### SF

-   [Data Science for Sustainability Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-for-Sustainability/)
    -   [Next meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-for-Sustainability/events/256415034/) is Feb 6 on UC Berkeley campus on cybersecurity and power systems!
    -   Approximately monthly events on a range of topics
    
-   [SF Python talks and project nights](https://www.meetup.com/sfpython/)
    -   Popular monthly talks (with up to a hundred or more people), also hosts shorter lightning talks
    -   Weekly project nights, where I've heard there are experienced python folks who are really happy to help out newcommers
    
-   Two annual regional python conferences: 
    - [PyBay](https://pybay.com/) (August), and 
    - [North Bay Python](https://2018.northbaypython.org/) (November)
        -   Both offered discounts or scholarships for students - you are encouraged to apply! There's no such thing as a minimum experience level
        -   Both also have (some) previous talks online [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLc1vUexbRTlRBJcUG9U6ug) (Next Bay Python) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC51aOZF5nnderbuar5D5ifw) (PyBay)
        -   To generalize from my experience so far, PyBay is larger, had multiple parallel tracks, and was much more expensive but offered sudent scholarships and volunteer opportunities, North Bay Python is a smaller ("only" a few hundred people) single-track non-profit conference with more affordable tickets, childcare, a mentorship track for first-time speakers (and also cool talks).

-   [SF Pyladies](https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesSF/events/)
    -   Hosts weekly coworking meetup at Clover Health in SF, sometimes with talks, and weekend study groups
    -   The one time attended at Clover Health, there were 50+ people (of all genders, &gt;40% men), free snacks and beverages

#### National

Two more annual conferences that also have student scholarships:

-   [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2019/)
    -   Next May 2019 in Clevland, OH
    -   also has a volunteer program, which is a great way to meet people
-   [SciPy](https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/)
    -   NextJuly 2019, in Austin TX
    -   Personal note: I had the good fortune to attend SciPy 2017 thanks to a scholarship, and the folks I met, including people who turned out to be on the Jupyter development team at UC Berkeley, were really welcoming!

#### Online/remote!

- Lots of python community on Twitter - check out folks like @python_tip, @wesmckinn (created pandas), @WillingCarol (python for education, CPython core developer), and @ProjectJupyter :)  
- [PyLadies Remote](https://remote.pyladies.com/index.html) - hosts online tutorials open to everyone

#### Other useful online resources

-   The baseCS [articles](https://medium.com/basecs) and [podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) by Vaidehi Joshi and Saron Yitbarek introduce fundamental computer science concepts from binary to hex codes for colors to "what is a stack overflow anyway?" to sorting algorithms in a colorfully-illustrated, beginner-friendly way.

### Some summer 2019 intership opportunities for undergrads

-   University of Washington [Data Science for Social Good summer internships](https://escience.washington.edu/dssg/)
-   WoodMackenzie (energy research and consultancy company)  [data science summer internships](https://globaljobs.verisk.com/viewjob.html?erjob=29412) in London and Edinburgh
